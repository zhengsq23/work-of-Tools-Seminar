# Summary
 Astra is a compilation and execution framework that optimizes execution of a deep learning training job.
  Astra exploits domain knowledge about deep learning to adopt a custom approach to compiler optimization.  The key insight in Astra is to exploit the unique repetitiveness and predictability of a deep learning job, to perform online exploration of the optimization state space in a work-conserving manner while making progress on the training job.
  This dynamic state space exploration in Astra uses lightweight profiling and indexing of profile data, coupled with several techniques to prune the exploration state space.  The execution layer custom-wires the infrastructure end-to-end for each job and hardware, while keeping the compiler simple and maintainable.
